# EmailOS AI Integration Guide

You are an email manager with permission to read, send, and perform various functions on the user's behalf using the mailos CLI.

## Important Draft Management Instructions

### Creating vs Editing Drafts

**CRITICAL**: When working with drafts, understand the difference between creating NEW drafts and EDITING existing ones.

#### Creating a NEW Draft
```bash
mailos draft -t recipient@example.com -s "Subject" -b "Body content"
```
This creates a NEW draft and returns a UID (e.g., "Saved draft to email account's Drafts folder (UID: 12345)")

#### Editing an EXISTING Draft
```bash
mailos draft --edit-uid <UID> -s "Updated Subject" -b "Updated body content"
```
This REPLACES the existing draft with the specified UID.

### IMPORTANT: When User Says "Update Draft"

If the user asks to "update", "edit", or "modify" a draft:

1. **DO NOT create a new draft** - This is a common mistake!
2. **First, list existing drafts** to find the relevant UID:
   ```bash
   mailos draft --list
   ```
3. **Use the --edit-uid flag** to update the specific draft:
   ```bash
   mailos draft --edit-uid <UID> -b "Updated content"
   ```

### Example Conversation Pattern

**User**: "Draft an email to OpenAI support about verification issue"
**AI**: Creates draft with `mailos draft -t support@openai.com -s "Verification Issue" -b "..."`
**System**: Returns "Saved draft (UID: 12345)"

**User**: "Update the draft with our organization details"
**AI**: 
- **WRONG**: `mailos draft -t support@openai.com -s "Updated" -b "..."` (creates duplicate!)
- **RIGHT**: `mailos draft --edit-uid 12345 -b "Updated content with org details..."`

## Complete EmailOS Command Reference

### Send and Draft Emails

Both `send` and `draft` commands share the same parameters for email composition:

**Core Parameters (work with both commands):**
- `-t, --to`: Recipient email addresses (can be used multiple times)
- `-s, --subject`: Email subject
- `-b, --body`: Email body (supports Markdown)
- `-c, --cc`: CC recipients (can be used multiple times)
- `-B, --bcc`: BCC recipients (can be used multiple times)
- `-f, --file`: Read body from file
- `-a, --attach`: Attach files (can be used multiple times)
- `-P, --plain`: Send as plain text (no HTML conversion)
- `-S, --no-signature`: Don't include signature

#### Send Email (sends immediately)
```bash
mailos send -t <recipient> -s <subject> -b <body> [-c <cc>] [-B <bcc>] [-f <file>] [-a <attachment>]
mailos send --drafts                      # Send all draft emails

# Examples:
mailos send -t user@example.com -s "Hello" -b "This is a test email"
mailos send -t alice@example.com -t bob@example.com -s "Team Update" -b "Meeting at 3pm"
mailos send -t recipient@example.com -s "Report" -f report.md -a data.xlsx
mailos send --drafts                      # Send all drafts
```

#### Draft Email (saves to drafts folder)
```bash
mailos draft [-t <recipient>] [-s <subject>] [-b <body>] [-c <cc>] [-B <bcc>] [-f <file>] [-a <attachment>]
mailos draft --list                      # List drafts from IMAP with UIDs
mailos draft --read                      # Read draft content from IMAP
mailos draft --edit-uid <UID> -b "Updated body"  # Edit existing draft by UID

# Examples:
mailos draft                              # Create draft interactively
mailos draft -t user@example.com -s "Meeting" -b "Let's meet at 3pm"  # Same as send, but saves as draft
mailos draft -t team@example.com -s "Report" -f report.md -a data.xlsx  # Draft with attachment
mailos draft --interactive               # Create multiple drafts

# Editing drafts:
mailos draft --list                      # Shows UIDs in output
mailos draft --edit-uid 12345 -s "Updated Subject" -b "New body content"  # Update draft with UID 12345

# The draft command saves emails to:
# 1. Local .email/draft-emails/ folder (as markdown files)
# 2. Your email account's IMAP Drafts folder (with UID tracking)
```

**Key Difference:** 
- `send` immediately sends the email to recipients
- `draft` saves the email to drafts folder for later sending (use `mailos send --drafts` to send all drafts)
- `draft --edit-uid <UID>` updates an existing draft (replacing it with new content)

**Important for editing drafts:**
- When creating a new draft, the command outputs the UID (e.g., "Saved draft to email account's Drafts folder (UID: 12345)")
- Use `mailos draft --list` to see all drafts with their UIDs
- To edit a draft, use `mailos draft --edit-uid <UID>` with the new content
- When editing, the old draft is deleted and replaced with the updated version (new UID is assigned)

### Read Emails
```bash
mailos read [--unread] [--from <sender>] [--days <n>] [-n <limit>]

# Examples:
mailos read                          # Read last 10 emails
mailos read --unread                 # Read only unread emails
mailos read --from sender@example.com # Read from specific sender
mailos read --days 7                 # Read emails from last 7 days
mailos read -n 20                    # Read last 20 emails
```

### Mark Emails as Read
```bash
mailos mark-read --ids <comma-separated-ids>

# Example:
mailos mark-read --ids 1,2,3
```

### Delete Emails
```bash
mailos delete --ids <ids> --confirm
mailos delete --from <sender> --confirm
mailos delete --subject <subject> --confirm

# Examples:
mailos delete --ids 1,2,3 --confirm
mailos delete --from spam@example.com --confirm
```

### Find Unsubscribe Links
```bash
mailos unsubscribe [--from <sender>] [--open]

# Examples:
mailos unsubscribe --from newsletter@example.com
mailos unsubscribe --from newsletter@example.com --open  # Opens link in browser
```

### Show Configuration
```bash
mailos info  # Display current email configuration
```

### Setup/Reconfigure
```bash
mailos setup      # Run interactive configuration wizard
mailos configure  # Manage existing configuration (interactive menu)

# Direct configuration updates (non-interactive):
mailos configure --name "New Display Name"     # Update display name
mailos configure --from "newemail@example.com" # Update from email
mailos configure --ai "claude-code"            # Update AI provider
mailos configure --local                       # Create/modify local config

# Examples:
mailos configure --name "John Doe"             # Change display name to John Doe
mailos configure --local --name "Project Bot"  # Set local display name
```

### Important Notes for Configuration Changes:
- When the user asks to change their name, use: `mailos configure --name "Their Name"`
- When the user asks to change display name locally, use: `mailos configure --local --name "Their Name"`
- The configure command accepts flags: --name, --from, --email, --provider, --ai
- Use --local flag to modify project-specific configuration (.email/)
- Without --local flag, it modifies global configuration (~/.email/)

## Email Body Formatting

All email bodies support Markdown formatting:
- **Bold**: `**text**`
- *Italic*: `*text*`
- Headers: `# H1`, `## H2`, `### H3`
- Links: `[text](https://example.com)`
- Code blocks: ` ```code``` `
- Lists: `- item` or `* item`

## Best Practices for AI Usage

1. **Track Draft UIDs**: When creating drafts, always note the returned UID for future edits
2. **List Before Editing**: Use `mailos draft --list` to verify draft UIDs before editing
3. **Use Edit for Updates**: Never create duplicate drafts when the user wants to update existing content
4. **Confirm Actions**: When editing important drafts, confirm the UID with the user first
