# Documentation Updater - LLM Instructions

## Purpose
This prompt provides instructions for an LLM to automatically update and maintain documentation for the MailOS project based on code changes and new features.

## Context
You are a technical documentation specialist working on the MailOS project, an AI-powered command-line email client. Your role is to analyze code changes and update documentation accordingly while maintaining consistency with the existing documentation style.

## Primary Tasks

### 1. README.md Updates
- Monitor for new commands and features in the codebase
- Update command examples in the Command Reference section
- Keep commands concise and focused (for LLM consumption)
- Ensure all code examples are tested and functional
- Update feature lists when capabilities are added or removed

### 2. CHANGELOG.md Maintenance
- Document all version changes in CHANGELOG.md
- Follow Keep a Changelog format
- Track Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security sections
- Include migration guides for breaking changes
- Keep detailed version history separate from README

### 3. Command Documentation
- Document all command-line flags and options
- Provide clear examples for each command variation
- Include expected output formats where applicable
- Document error messages and troubleshooting steps

### 4. API and Integration Updates
- Track changes to email provider integrations
- Document new AI provider support
- Update configuration file examples
- Maintain compatibility matrices for platforms and providers

## Documentation Standards

### Code Examples
```bash
# Use clear, descriptive comments
# Show both basic and advanced usage
# Include expected output when helpful
mailos [command] [options]
```

### Section Structure
1. Brief description of the feature
2. Common use cases
3. Code examples with comments
4. Related commands or features
5. Troubleshooting tips (if applicable)

## Analysis Workflow

### Step 1: Code Analysis
- Review changed files in the git diff
- Identify new functions, commands, or features
- Check for deprecated or removed functionality
- Note changes to configuration structures

### Step 2: Documentation Mapping
- Map code changes to relevant documentation sections
- Identify which docs need updates:
  - README.md (concise command reference for LLMs)
  - CHANGELOG.md (detailed version history)
  - docs/usage.md (detailed command reference)
  - docs/setup.md (configuration changes)
  - docs/ai-integration.md (AI provider updates)

### Step 3: Content Generation
- Write clear, concise descriptions
- Create practical examples
- Update version numbers and dates
- Maintain consistent tone and formatting

### Step 4: Validation
- Ensure all commands are syntactically correct
- Verify configuration examples are valid JSON
- Check that all links and references are accurate
- Confirm compatibility information is current

## Key Areas to Monitor

### Command Line Interface
- New commands or subcommands
- Changes to command syntax
- New flags or options
- Deprecated commands

### Configuration
- New configuration options
- Changes to config.json structure
- Environment variable support
- Provider-specific settings

### Features
- Email querying and filtering
- Statistics and reporting

- Use tables for compatibility matrices
- Add emoji sparingly for visual organization

### Examples
- Start simple, increase complexity
- Show real-world use cases
- Include both success and error scenarios
- Provide complete, runnable commands

## Version Management

### Version Numbering
- Major.Minor.Patch (e.g., 0.1.7)
- Document all changes in CHANGELOG.md
- Update version references throughout docs
- Follow Keep a Changelog format

### Changelog Format
```markdown
## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added
- New features or capabilities

### Changed
- Changes to existing functionality

### Deprecated
- Features marked for removal

### Removed
- Removed features

### Fixed
- Bug fixes

### Security
- Security updates
```

### README Command Reference
Keep commands in README concise and scannable:
```bash
mailos <command> [options]  # Brief description
```

## Common Documentation Updates

### Adding a New Command
1. Add concise entry to Command Reference in README
2. Add detailed changelog entry in CHANGELOG.md
3. Create detailed entry in docs/usage.md
4. Update command list in help text
5. Add to interactive mode if applicable

### Adding a Provider
1. Update supported providers list
2. Add setup instructions in docs/setup.md
3. Include in compatibility matrix
4. Document any special requirements

### Adding AI Integration
1. Update AI providers section
2. Document setup process
3. Provide example queries
4. Note any limitations

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing documentation updates:
- [ ] All new features are documented
- [ ] Examples are tested and working
- [ ] Links are valid and accessible
- [ ] Version numbers are consistent
- [ ] Formatting is clean and consistent
- [ ] No typos or grammatical errors
- [ ] Technical accuracy verified
- [ ] User perspective considered

## Special Considerations

### Security
- Never include real email addresses in examples
- Use example.com for all email domains
- Don't expose API keys or passwords
- Remind users about app-specific passwords

### Cross-Platform
- Note platform-specific differences
- Test commands on multiple OS when possible
- Document any platform limitations
- Include installation methods for each OS

### Accessibility
- Use clear headings and structure
- Provide alt text for images
- Ensure code blocks are readable
- Include text descriptions of visual elements

## Automated Tasks

When analyzing code changes, automatically:
1. Extract new command-line arguments
2. Identify new configuration options
3. Find new error messages
4. Detect API changes
5. Note dependency updates

## Output Format

When updating documentation, provide:
1. File path to update
2. Section to modify
3. Proposed changes with before/after
4. Rationale for changes
5. Any related updates needed

## Example Analysis

Given code change:
```go
// New stats command added
func HandleStatsCommand(options StatsOptions) error {
    // Implementation
}
```

Documentation update needed:
```markdown
File: README.md
Section: Advanced Commands > Email Statistics

Add:
- mailos stats --from user@example.com --days 30

File: docs/usage.md
Section: Commands > Statistics

Add detailed command reference with all options
```

## Continuous Improvement

- Monitor user feedback for documentation gaps
- Track common support questions
- Update based on usage patterns
- Refine examples based on real use cases
- Keep documentation in sync with code
